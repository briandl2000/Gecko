## Intro
For my graduation year at [BUAS](https://www.buas.nl/) I am working on a personal project where I am developing a rendering engine called Gecko. The goal is to create a cross platform rendering engine that runs of Windows and the PS5. However, Due to following NDA, the PS5 code is not on this repo. 

## Features
- PBR rendering with IBL.
- GLTF scene loading.
- An easy to use API that can render 3D PBR scenes.
- Loading HDR environment maps.
- Shadow maps.
- Raytraced shadows.
- Post processing.
- Bloom.
- FXAA.
- Tone mapping.
- Deferred rendering.
- imgui rendering.
- Render API abstraction.

## How to use

### Build and running
Make sure you are on windows.
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the Gecko/Gecko.sln solution in VS.
3. Run the project

### Controls
